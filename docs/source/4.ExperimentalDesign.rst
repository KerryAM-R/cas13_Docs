4. Front-End: Experimental design
=================================
.. note::

    This section requires the filtered table as the input from a single genus/subgenus 


UI of the experimental Design
------------------------------
The analysis section is divided into several sub-sections. 

- Upload the Guide table
- Add in Adaptors 
- Sequence (nt and protein)

Uploaded files
--------------

Ensure that the user can see that their file has been uploaded to do either the 'adaptor' or x experimental design consideration

Side bar
^^^^^^^^

Upload the TSV files from the "Fitlered Table" or "Motif Tab" in the conservation 

Main panel 
^^^^^^^^^^

Renders the uploaded table

Add in Adaptors
---------------

If the research is wanting to use the x experimental approach, they can automate adding in their required adaptors to the sequence

Side bar
^^^^^^^^

5' Adaptor:
- The user can select the sequence to add to the guide
- Default: CACC

3' Adaptor
- The user can select the sequence to add to the guide
- Default: CAAC


Main panel 
^^^^^^^^^^


Showcases a table with: plate, loc (location), Gudie_name and guide_sequence

This process automatally adds in the adaptors for the forward and reverse sequence

It ensure that the location is defined based on a 96 well plate (A to H and 1-12)

If there is more than 1 plate worth it will restart the number at A1 to H12. 


Sequence (nt and protein)
--------------------------

This section aims to extract the protein coding genes for any given guide. This links back to the original sequence database and extracts either the whole gene or a 150bp snippet.

Side bar
^^^^^^^^

Upload Gudies:
- list the guide present from the uploaded table

Virus genus:
- Select the genus as this links to the backend sequence data

Rule Type:
- Type of rule applied from the original processing (e.g., GG)

Ref anno:
- The sequence is for the exact match 

Add metadata
- The user can select to include the metadata in the table
- Default: Selected

Main panel 
^^^^^^^^^^

The Table shows the process data of extracting one sequence per exact and near matches. It also extracts one sequence that is a no-match

- Location:
    - This is to altered the rough location of the no-match guide
    - The user can alter the number to find the lowest edit distance. This is usually within the starting location ±3nt
    - Default: 60

The user can download the table that includes the guide, the complete protein coding seuqence, and the segment (150bp), as well as where the gene occured in the selected genome sequence

This will enable testing of the conservation in reporter setting where the native virus sequence is not accessible (e.g., strain is only present in animal reserviour)
