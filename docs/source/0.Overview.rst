Welcome to the Cas13 pipeline and platform!

The devleoped pipeline is broken down into four stages:

1. Retreive the data (Backend)
2. Process the sequences to guides (Engine)
3. Interrogiate and filter the guide data (Front-End: Analysis)
4. Process to aid in experimental design (Front-End: Experimental Design)
