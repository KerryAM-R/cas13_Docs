3. Front-End: Analysis
=======================

The Cas13 Platform was developed for the rapid identification of highly conserved and potent guides for therapeutics.

Key Features
------------

- ✅ Run analyses interactively
- ✅ Export results for downstream use

Supported Virus Genera
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Currently available Genera:**

- Sarbecovirus
- Merbecovirus
- Enterovirus A71

.. note::
   
   Identify guides the Virologist, Immunologist etc. wishes to test. 
   The application detects the current Genera in the database. 

Application structure

- Overview
- Conservation

Common Side Bar Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Virus Genus:** contains the list of viral genus/subgenus in the frontend database

**Rule Type:** Showcases the types of rules processed. The default is the **GG** rule.

**Background & Grid**

- Theme preset: Light or Dark
  - This will reactively set the background to either black or white

- Backgroup Type: Colour or Transparent
  - The user has flexibility to downlaod the background of the graphs as either a designated colour or transparent, depending on the publication requirements

- Background colour
  - the user either select a colour from the grid, use the hexadecimal naming system or use a colour name (e.g., white)

- Grid Line Colour
  - Default: grey
  - the user either select a colour from the grid, use the hexadecimal naming system or use a colour name (e.g., grey)

**Text & Font**

- Font
  - The program uses the "FontHelper" package to find all the system fonts. They have been grouped by origin.
  - Default: Times New Roman 

- Axis Title Size
  - changes the x-axis and y-axis titles for all of the graphs
  - Default: 24

- Axis Text Size
  - changes the x-axis and y-axis tick marks for all of the graphs (e.g, tick marks)
  - Default: 20

- Text Colour
  - the user either select a colour from the grid, use the hexadecimal naming system or use a colour name (e.g., white)
  - Default: Black (Light theme) or White (dark theme)

- Strip Text Size
  - When the user splits the graph (e.g., Bar plot selected Split by header), the graphs will have a bar with the name of the split variable
  - Default: 24

**Legend**

- Legend Text Size
  - Changes the size of the listed variables
  - Default: 20

- Legend Title Size
  - Changes the size of the Legend Title, if present
  - Default: 30

- Legend Columns
  - The user can select the number of columns in the list of variables 
  - Default: 1

- Legend Location
  - The user can select the number of columns in the list of variables 
  - Default: none (Colouring and x-axis/y-axis are identical to remove redundancy) or right

**Colour Data**

- Colour by:
  - List all of the headers
  - Default: mapped_region

- Colouring Palette
  - The User can select their preferred starting colouring theme: default (R colouring defaults), rainbow, random, heat.colors, terrain.colors, topo.colors, hcl.colors, one
  - Default: default

- List of variables that can be coloured
  - Users can update the list as required 

1. Overview
-----------

The goal of this section is to showcases what data is present in the application, and a summary table of the backend to the front end processing 

Side Bar Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bar Plot
""""""""

- Type of Plot
  - the user can display the data as either Counts (0 to U-0221E) or Proportions (0 to 1)
  - *Note: those with n=1 can be difficult to see the bar*

- Log Transform the counts?
  - Can use a log10 transformation of the count data so the extreme variables are less obvious 
  - *Note: those with n=1 will be 0 with log10 when transformation*

- Filter by: 
  - The user can choose to remove variables from the bar graph
  - Default: mapped_region

- X-axis:
  - The user can select the x-axis variable to display
  - Default: mapped_region

- Split by header:
  - The user can split the graph intot he various categories that is linked to the **Filter by:** heading

Main panel
^^^^^^^^^^

Tab 1. Guide Table Summary
""""""""""""""""""""""""""


- the opening section shows the total number of guides presented for further filtering

Tab 2. Guide data
"""""""""""""""""

**Table** 

Allows the user to do an initial exploration of the data and see if their proteins and/or regions of interest are present in the database.

Additionally, this ensures that the scientist can extract the intial summary table for publication purposes.

- Summarise by this column(s): 
   - defaults: mapped_region and Category

Table

- summary statiscts based on the **summarise by this column(s)**
- Table is downloaded as a .csv file 



**Bar plot**

Purpose is to visulise the summary statistics of one column (x-axis) and coloured by a second variable if desired

The user can start with either **selecting all?** based on the *X-axis:* 

The user can then determine if they wish to filter out the variables within in the columns selected in *Filter by:*

*note: see **bar plot** side bar panel for customising the plot*
