2. Backend
==================

This section describes how the sequences were processed from NCBI to local database with the necessary information required for the Engine 

.. note:: 
    Consideration for the analysis.  
       The pipeline was built for scRNA-seq with scTCR-seq datasets. 

       QC documentation is being actively updated. 
    Prerequisite
       Install cas13_platform/Backend. 


Running Backend
---------------
Now the the R environment is set up and the Cas13_platform/Backend and its dependencies are installed, we can now run the application.

Run the following lines in R. A window will opened that runs the backend shiny R application. Tnhis will bring up a shinyR UI for creating the databases

::

        require(cas13.backend)

        cas13.backend::Processing_platform()


You are now ready to retrive the seuqence data from NCBI or from your own references

1. Create the databases (SQLite and JSON)
   - The user will see 

	Designed for Viruses
	Next version will also be created for Bacteria and Human
2. Extract the IDs from NCBI based on term list
3. Add the sequences and metadata to the db
4. Extract the Kingdom information (taxonomy) - other terms?
5. Extract NCBI annotationSequences from NCBI
6. Add in additional sequences
7. Normalise annotation to create consistency, if required
8. Rscript to create iqTree for the Front End analysis
